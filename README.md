### What I learned

Undertaking this e-commerce project has been a journey of significant learning and skill enhancement, particularly in mastering Redux and Firebase. The use of Redux was a pivotal aspect of the project, allowing me to efficiently manage the state of various website functionalities like adding to and removing items from the shopping cart. Despite the initial challenges due to its novelty, my proficiency with Redux grew as I delved deeper into its practical applications, eventually finding it an invaluable tool for state management. Additionally, integrating Firebase for backend operations opened new horizons in my development skills. It enabled me to implement robust user authentication processes, allowing users to log in and out while ensuring their shopping data, such as cart items, is securely saved.
